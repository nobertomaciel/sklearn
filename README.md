# sklearn complementary clustering measures

## Xie Beni Index
**Compute the Xie Beni Index.**
https://github.com/nobertomaciel/sklearn/blob/main/xie_beni.py

    Xie and Beni introduced Xie-Beni (XB) index method in 1991. 
    XB index is focus on separation and com- pactness. 
    Separation is a measure of the distance between one cluster and 
    another cluster and compactness is a measure of proximity between data 
    points in a cluster (Lathief 2020).

    The minimum score is zero, with lower values indicating better clustering.

    .. versionadded:: 0.10

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        A list of ``n_features``-dimensional data points. Each row corresponds
        to a single data point.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted labels for each sample.

    Returns
    -------
    score: float
        The resulting Xie Beni Index.

## SSE
**Compute the Sum of Squared Error.**
https://github.com/nobertomaciel/sklearn/blob/main/sse.py

    The Sum of Squared Error in cluster analisys get all distances between 
    an element and the center of cluster.

    The minimum score is zero (when elements are equal to center of cluster), 
    with lower values indicating better clustering.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        A list of ``n_features``-dimensional data points. Each row corresponds
        to a single data point.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted labels for each sample.

    Returns
    -------
    score: float
        The resulting SSE value.
